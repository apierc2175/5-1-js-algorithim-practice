  <p>
    A. Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array that has a minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed. For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.
  </p>
  <p>
    B.  Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest. For example, if this array were passed as an argument: ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"] would return the following array:  ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.
